TANKS - By alexia-maria
Tanks is a simplistic clone of the game "Battle city" from 1985.

I heard of the game "Battle city" from my friend who played it as a kid. When he told me about it, I thought it would be a fun idea to try to recreate it. 

In this game, you play as a tank, trying to kill as many enemies as you can before you die.

Score is how many waves of enemies you can survive before dying.
